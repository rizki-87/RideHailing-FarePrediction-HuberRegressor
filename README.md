# RideHailing-FarePrediction-HuberRegressor

## ***Overview***
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Ride-Hailing Fare Prediction Model. This project focuses on developing a predictive model using the Huber loss function, renowned for its robustness against outliers. Instead of deploying the model itself, we have created an interactive Streamlit application that showcases the visualizations derived from our model. 

## ***Project Workflow***
1. Data Loading, Overview, and Cleaning
Loading Data: Importing the necessary data for our model.
Data Overview: Initial exploration to understand the dataset's structure and contents.
Cleaning Process: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
2. Data Visualization
Insightful Visuals: Creating visual representations of our data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
Interpretation: Each visualization is accompanied by an analysis that aids in understanding the dataset's characteristics.
3. Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and Modeling
Preprocessing: Making the data suitable for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Enhancing the dataset with new features to improve the model's performance.
Model Development: Developing a predictive model using the Huber loss function.
4. Model Inference
Model Testing: Testing the final model with new data to evaluate its predictive capabilities.
Results and Interpretation: Discussing the performance and insights of the model.

## ***Deployment***
Streamlit Application: Showcasing the visualizations derived from our model. The Streamlit app is user-friendly and provides interactive access to the project's visual insights. Experience it [here](https://ridehailing-fareprediction-apperregreappr-9whuxb5knfkum6bhgoe8.streamlit.app/).

## ***How to Use***
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebooks in sequential order to understand the model development process.
Explore the Streamlit app for interactive visualizations of the model.
